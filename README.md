===========

This repository contains the standard parts of my home user environment. I go back and forth between many computers, at home and work, and use Linux/Mac/Windows. This project helps me keep all of my machines in sync, and to have tools that (hopefully) work on all platforms for my common tasks.

My main utilities are
-------------------------
<dl>
  <dt>vmod</dt>
  <dd>Open up (in vim) all currently modified file. Can also get a list of all files touched in the current branch, and open those instead.</dd>
  <dt>crbuild</dt>
  <dd>Tool to make it easier to build all/parts of [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) and run (if applicable).</dd>
  <dt>git-rebaseall</dt>
  <dd>Rebase all Git branches onto their parent.</dd>
</dl>

That's about it. Nothing super cool.
